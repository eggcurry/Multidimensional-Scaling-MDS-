# Multidimensional-Scaling-MDS-
Implementation of multidimensional scaling analysis (MDS). Outputs plots for all dimension combinations. Also outputs a scree plot to check the usefulness of the number of dimensions used. 
To run, download all the files and run RUN_MDS_main.m on Matlab. Further instructions in Readme.txt and in the code.
Written for TaPer Lab. This was written to study dimensions involved in texture perception. Contact vanalata@gmail.com for questions.
