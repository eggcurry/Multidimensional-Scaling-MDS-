To run it:
1. Unzip the folder
2. Add file containing the data into the folder (can be csv or excel, maybe even a textfile)
3. Open the file titled RUN_MDS_main.m in MATLAB (highlighted and pointed to by a red arrow in the attached image).
(Note: all the files with an fx symbol are files that are functions and the ones with the MATLAB symbol are files which are scripts.)4. Load data into MATLAB. Can do this in 2 ways: 
    4.1. Replace the name of your data file under optional import in the RUN_MDS_main.m file. Where to change is also marked by a red arrow in attached image.    4.2. Follow instructions at the top of RUN_MDS_main.m to use the MATLAB buttons to import the data. Remember to rename it as "data " (without the quotes) or replace data with filename in the runMDS function. 
5. Change parameters if needed (number of dimensions, distance measure and whether MDS objects are column names or row names)
6. Run the file (Editor -> press big green play button)
